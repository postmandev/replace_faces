CIS581 final project - 2014

Michael Woods (micwoods) & Michael O'Meara (momeara)

==== Setup ===

1) Go into the 'fitw_detect' directory and run the compile.m file.
2) If 'data/reference_face.mat' does not exist (it should), run 
   process_reference_images.m from the project base directory

==== Output Images ====

We ran our project on all images from the "easy", "hard", "blending", "pose", 
and "more" sets. The results are located in the "final_images" directory.

==== Test Script ====

All images from the easy, hard, blending, pose, and more sets can be 
replaced and viewed from the test.m file in the project directory.

==== Extra Credit ====

We rendered a video clip with the face replaced. It is located in 
"final_images/video/videoclip_replaced.mp4".
